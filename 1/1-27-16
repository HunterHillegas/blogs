# Is your website hurting your bottom line?
It is clear that in today's crowded online space, a functional and well designed website is an essential tool for helping businessess compete in the modern economy.  
I would be willing to bet that there are very few, if any, people who would disagree with this claim.
For many businesses, the company website is the first point of communication between teh business and consumers.  
Creating a good first impressions with your website is remarkably beneficial for increasing brand awareness, developing relationships with consumers, and converting consumers to your brand and products. 
Ultimately, these benefits will reveal themselves as growth as in your company's bottom line.  
Companies that understand the relationship between the digital and physical, and successfully traveserve the divide, typically outperform those that do not.
