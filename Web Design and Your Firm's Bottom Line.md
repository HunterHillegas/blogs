## Web Design and Your Firm's Bottom Line
Think your company’s website isn’t important?  Think again.  Last week I wrote an article {link to article} that loosely addressed this question by comparing the websites of Company X and one of their competitors.  The analysis allowed for a great illustration of how web users interact with companies via the Internet.  However, the previous article didn’t address the relationship between a company’s online efforts and their bottom line (i.e. $$$).   This article aims to do just that.  So, sit back, relax, and let’s talk numbers.

# The Numbers and Data

***The Users***

Users increasingly value websites that are both functional and adaptable.  By that, I mean the website is capable of operation on either mobile or PC devices without the loss of functionality or features.  When company websites and apps are constructed in such a manner, the user behavior is much more promising for the bottom line.   

*	74% of users are more likely to return to a site that is mobile-friendly
*	95% of consumers agreed that “good user experience just makes sense”
*	83% of users claim that a seamless experience across all their devices is somewhat or very important
*	81% of users conduct research online before heading out to a store, restaurant, movie theater… the list goes on and on  

However, when websites lack functionality or adaptability, users tend to behave in ways that negatively impact the company and their bottom line.   

*	61% of users quickly move onto another site if they are unable to find what they are looking for on a mobile-friendly site
*	When a website isn’t optimized for mobile, users are 5 times more likely to give up on the task

              Of those users, 79% will seek out a different site to finish the task
*	79% of consumers who don’t like what they find on one website will search for another website
